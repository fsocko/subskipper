180=When surfaced, the watch crew represents the Submarines eyes. It is important to have an efficient crew here, to timely detect both targets and threats.
181=One of the most important sections of the boat, the radio room keeps the connection with submarine HQ alive, when surfaced. Underwater, the hydrophone becomes the boat's ears, detecting targets beyond visual range and keeping the close range tactical situation under control.
182=The brain of the submarine holds together all systems required to effectively command the submarine.
183=The Diesel engines are the submarine's long range, surfaced, means of propulsion. Losing these will leave the boat practically immobile.
184=The silent electric engines are the submarine's means of propulsion for underwater travel.
185=Bearing most of your torpedo armament, this section represents the combat potential of your submarine. An efficient crew assigned here will keep the reload times low.
186=The main accommodation area of the submarine is of vital importance in ensuring that the crew is rested and ready to do battle. Off duty crewmen should be assigned here.
187=Off duty crewmen should be assigned to either quarters to rest.
188=Of secondary importance for attack purposes, the stern torpedo room is also host to a number of mechanisms important for maneuvering the boat. 
189=This is the mounting location for the deck gun. It should be used to engage lone merchants, targets not worth a torpedo or crippled ships that require a coup de grace. 
190=Against aircraft, the submarine's best defense is diving. When that is not possible, the AA cannons should give any attacker something to worry about.
191=Off duty crew can be assembled in a Damage Control Team to assist repairing in critical sections of the submarine.

2340=Batteries capacity affects the submarine's underwater endurance and severely restricts its mobility during combat.
2341=Compressed air is needed to change depth without using your engines and to blow ballast in emergency situations. 
2342=Running out of Oxygen - when staying underwater too long - will fatigue your crew and ultimately lead to their death. 
2343=Fuel is needed to power the diesel engines, which are the uboat's long distance mean of propulsion. 
2344=Damage taken by the submarine will be more severe.  
2345=Increase systems repair times to more realistic values.  
2346=The time it takes for a ship to sink is increased. This will make judging inflicted damage levels more difficult. 
2347=Only allow manual data gathering mode for torpedo attacks. 
2348=Disable "god's eye mode" for the navigation map.  
2349=Reduce uboat's sensors detection radius and efficiency. 
2350=Increase torpedo malfunction probability to historical values. 
2351=Use historical loading times for the torpedoes. This will degrade your ability to conduct multiple attacks during one engagement. 
2352=Disable the Picture in Picture view showing important events in the area. 
2353=Restrict usage of external camera. Only camera modes that are connected to the submarine will be available.
2354=Disabling camera stabilization will make aiming and observing targets difficult in rough seas.
2355=The noise meter provides a simple visual gauge of how detectable the uboat is at a given moment.

5500=When selected, the batteries that power your sub's electric engines are limited. This, in turn, limits the amount of time you can stay submerged before the batteries must be recharged. 
5501=When selected, your sub uses an amount of compressed air to surface, blowing air in the ballast tanks. If you exhaust your supply, you will have difficulties in bringing the submarine to the surface. Compressed is regenerated by your compressor when the submarine is running on the surface, so keep that piece of equipment is vital. 
5502=When the submarine is submerged, the crew uses oxygen and generates CO2. With time, the air will become un-breathable, affecting the performance of the crew and even leading to their death. When this option is selected, you must surface your sub periodically to resupply your sub with fresh air. 
5503=When selected, your sub has limited fuel, and, therefore, limited range. You must return to base before your fuel supply is exhausted. There are no refueling subs in the game. You will get a warning during a patrol when you have used 50% of your fuel.
5504=When selected, damage repairs will take longer.
5505=When selected, you must enter the appropriate information into the TDC when firing torpedoes. You can not simply point the TBT or periscope at a target and fire.
5506=When selected, hydrophone and visual contacts will not appear on the navigation map. Radio contacts, however, will periodically appear on the map.
5507=When selected, the effectiveness of your hydrophones and radar is reduced.
5508=When selected, your torpedoes will periodically malfunction. Malfunctioning torpedoes may either detonate too early, or not detonate at all.
5509=When selected, it will take a considerable amount of time to reload your torpedo tubes. 
5510=When selected, the event camera is disabled. 
5511=When selected, the external camera is disabled.
5512=When selected, your targeting optics (ie. the TBT or the attack periscope) will be realistically affected by submarines movement on the waves. This will make targeting in rough seas much more difficult.
5513=When selected, the noise meter, which gives an indication of how detectable your submarine is at the moment, will be disabled. 
5514=When selected, the Weapon Officer will not identify targets or calculate firing solutions for you. You must determine range, speed, and AOB by yourself.

5820=The career is over because:
5821=You have been given the command of a new submarine. Do you accept?
5822=The conning tower has been upgraded.
5823=You have been offered a desk job, to command the entire flotilla. Do you accept?
5824=Your submarine was damaged but your great result recommend you for the command of a new submarine. Do you accept?
5825=You have been given the command of a new submarine.
5826=Your submarine has been retired and you have been given the command of a new submarine.

5830=You've managed to sink a target of high importance... to your own side.  Your crew hangs their heads in shame as you're escorted by MPs off your ship and to the brig.  As captain and commander, the responsibility for the lives of your fellow Americans that were killed lies solely with you.  None of your previous achievements or lack thereof matter at all now as the charges are prepared.
5831=You return to port amid hearty cheers, as even the least informed crew members are now aware:  Japan has Surrendered!  The war is now over and you can finally accept the desk position they've been pushing on you since forever it seems.

5860=At the best, you'll stand accused of gross incompetence, at worse, high treason. The worst of it though is that you'll never see the deck of a ship ever again, let alone command one. Unmercifully, your trial has been scheduled to begin after the cessation of hostilities. Nothing to do now but linger in the brig until Japan decides to give up.
5861=Your sub may have seen the last of the blue sky, but you and your crew will be forever remembered in the annals of naval history. Posthumously, the next of kin of all on board were awarded some of the highest medals of bravery the Navy could offer, but unfortunately none would know or could know the circumstances of your final hours.
5862=A fitting  end for a career captain, you go down with your ships with little to regret or to remember for that matter. Your later funeral was filled with epithets about a quiet and cautious man who only wanted to serve his country. As the sounds of straining steel and rushing water rain around you, you have no doubt you could have done worse.
5863=Although the Admiral wrote that he regretted to inform your next of kin of your demise at sea, something makes you suspect that he was actually a bit relieved. Thankfully, and maybe out of respect for someone that ultimately gave their life in the service, your abysmal record was scrubbed before making it to the National Archives. Your family still thinks of you as a hero at least.
5864=Your retirement from life on the high seas didn't seem to make you slow down in the least. The end of the war was only the beginning for your stunning Navy career, and your later position as an industrialist. A healthy portion of your memoirs is taken up by your exploits and the lives and personalities of the men you served with, and the best stories you could tell your grandchildren always seemed to involve your days as a Wolf of the Pacific.
5865=Regardless of your experience in the Navy, with a solid resume of leadership your life after the war was the basic American dream. You have a nice family in a quiet town with a modest job. You still reminisce at the Legion Post about the old days when you had something else to be equally proud of, getting your loyal crew through a war alive and well.
5866=Thus, your completely lackluster career has come to a close. Perhaps if you had been just a bit more aggressive or paid more attention, or even just went by the book you wouldn't be regretting your time during the war well into old age. Your crew is safe and sound at least, as most survived their tenure under you. That is at least one bright spot in your otherwise poor record.  

5867=This last patrol proved to be the last straw for your beleaguered colleagues trying to keep you in the captain's chair. Your repeated poor performance has forced the US Navy, in its infinite wisdom, to promote you! You are now in charge of your own little compartment in a new building called the Pentagon, but with no water in sight, you start to suspect your career as a captain on the high seas is long over. The Navy can now rest assured that at least nobody will make off with your office chair.
5868=With another stunning success, your colleagues in high command have sent you a telegram of congratulations and news of a promotion right to the docks as you walk off the gangplank. The Navy now thinks it can use your vast experience as a sub commander at Annapolis, teaching submarine warfare to fresh cadets. Accept the position and End your career at sea?
5869=The brutal fight you've returned from the Japanese is nothing compared to the one in the Admiral's office you currently face. Despite your considerable skills, the Admiral thinks you should probably take things a little easier and more along the lines of your real ability. You've been placed on his staff, effective immediately, and 2 creams, no sugar is how he takes it.
5870=As you pull into port, the mechanics are already on the dock scratching their heads in amazement that you managed to float home. You expected the Admiral to be a little miffed at the loss of his sub, but he so far he's just grunted as he signed off on a requisition order to put you in a new one. At least your previous record counted for something. The question now it whether or not you should quit while you're ahead. Resign your commission and End your military career on a high note?
5871=The department of the Navy has begun decommissioning your current class of submarine.  The Admiral on the base has put you first in line to receive new upgrade due to your performance. You could go with the philosophy of 'if it ain't broke, don't fix it', however, and continue with your old trusty boat. Do take the new submarine and Continue?
5872=Shiny new sub models are constantly rolling off the assembly line as the war effort ratchets up. Due to your performance, you've been placed first in line to receive one of these newer models as they arrive at the base. You could, however, turn it down if you prefer your current model. Do take the new submarine and Continue?
5873=The department of the Navy has begun retiring your current class of submarine from front line operations. Noting your less-than-notable performance, the US Navy Bureau of Personnel has decided to mothball you along with the ship.

7600=Your actions during the last patrol have stained the honor of the Kriegsmarine. Enemy propaganda will greatly benefit from news of your exploits and you can only wonder how much damage you have done to the war effort.| The secret police carries you away and you know that sometime, somewhere, you will pay for your actions..
7601=The radio man hurries to you with a message. Its from the Onkel, and it brings news of the predictable end: The war is over!||My U-boat men! Six years of submarine warfare lie behind us. You have fought like Lions! A crushing material superiority has forced us into a narrow area. A continuation of our fight on the remaining basis is no longer possible. U-boat men! Undefeated and unblemished you lay down your arms after a heroic battle without equal. We remember in deep respect our fallen comrades, who have sealed with death their loyalty to Fuehrer and Fatherland!||Comrades! Preserve your U-boat spirit, with which you have fought courageously, stubbornly, and imperturbably through the years for the good of the Fatherland.||Long Live Germany!|Your Grand Admiral

7620=At the best, you'll stand accused of gross incompetence, at worse, high treason. The worst of it though is that you'll never see the deck of a ship ever again, let alone command one. Unmercifully, your trial has been scheduled to begin after the cessation of hostilities. Nothing to do now but linger in the brig until Japan decides to give up.
7621=An example to admire for all aspiring commanders, you would have made a great leader in postwar navy.
7622=Your promising career was ended abruptly. Your comrades wish you were given the time to become another u-boat ace, but the truth is war doesn�t forgive mistakes.
7623=You have added another shadow in the Ehrenhalle. Your family proudly remembers you but you are lost in the annals of maritime war history.
7624=Probably one of the most successful submarine commander ever, you become a respected Admiral in NATO navy. In the 21st century, Ubisoft uses your expertise and advice to create Silent Hunter III.
7625=With the war over, you become a leader in the new German Navy. Often consulted by historians in the problems of u-boat warfare, you are one of the most famous figures associated with it.
7626=The war is over. You return to your family and civilian life, proud to have been once part of the German u-boat force.

7627=The battle of the Atlantic needs every man, but not any kind of man. You have proved your place is not here with the aggressive wolfpacks envisioned by Admiral Doenitz. As you get your bag and hand the boat over,  you sincerely hope what lies ahead is still a job in the Kriegsmarine, and not the train to the Eastern Front.
7628=Germany needs its heroes, but it needs them alive. The Fuehrer has insisted that you are not to go on another combat patrol, and Doenitz has agreed that you are to take a command assignment.| Do you want to END your front line commander career?
7629=As tough as the u-boats are, you have carried yours to the end of her fighting days. The crew is lucky to have made it home, but this also signals the end of your less than glorious career.
7630=Be more aggressive! said the Onkel, and you have obeyed him to the letter. With your battered, scrapyard bound u-boat as proof of your performance, you know that a new assignment is waiting for you. You could opt out and help run the Ubootwaffe, but the struggle in the deep is far from over. Do you continue as a front line commander?
7631=MESSAGE N/A: Unit retired & Good player performance.
7632=As your submarine pulls into port you spot an officer waiting in the crowd. After greeting you warmly he gets straight to the point: your spectacular performance recommends you for the command of a new type u-boat. It�s a whole new beast though, so you can refuse and continue on your present command. Do you accept the new assignment and Continue?
7633=MESSAGE N/A: Unit retired & Bad player performance.
7634=MESSAGE N/A: Player receive new conning tower.

7635=General Quarters
7636=Watch, Quarter, and Station Bill
