#SubSkipper

The GitHub SubSkipper repository contains the core logic of the app, such that it can be verified or used for other projects. The documentation contains the principles and equations on which the logic is based, and some method documentation.

The main purpose of the repository and documentation is to record techniques and methods of early submarine attack techniques in a way which are simple to employ in computer programs (i.e. showing mathematical equations where possible), as well as acting as a reference for Submarine Simulators.
